In this study, we are developing a geospatial and spatio-statistical analysis of the geographic dimension of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) in New York state. The restrictions put in place to limit the diffusion and impacts of Covid-19 have had a widespread impact on peopleâ€™s lives. \n",
